# Act 1: Unlock Business Value

## What Are We Building?

- Application Scenario: Shopping Assistant For Zava
- Agentic Architecture: Inventory Agent, Conversational Agent, Loyalty Agent
- Business Goals: Move Inventory, Build Revenue, Retain Customers
- Engineering Challenges: Accuracy/Precision, Cost, Performance

## What is Model Optimization

- Evaluation-Driven Development: Define Metrics, Set Targets, Optimize 
- Model Optimization Targets: Accuracy, Cost, Performance (Latency)
- Model Optimization Vectors: 
    - Optimize Instructions: Prompt Engineering
    - Optimize Context (Data): RAG
    - Optimize Behavior (Model): Fine Tuning
    - Optimize Performance (Hybrid): RAG + FT + Prompt Engineering

## Why Focus on Fine Tuning?

- Desirable Skill => Domain-specific needs, Differentiated behaviors
- Developer Experience => Reduced complexity, Streamlined workflows
- Diverse Options => Supervised, Distillation, Reinforcement, DPO etc.

## Model Optimization in Zava

1. Model Selection: Start with quality model => GPT4.1 for Chat Agent
1. Prompt Engineering: Instruction tuning => fluent, coherent, polite
1. Retrieval Augmented Generation: Set context => relevance, groundedness
1. Fine Tuning: How can we improve from here?
