## Getting Help On Azure AI Foundry 

The Azure AI Foundry platform is moving fast! If you have questions, here are three resources to keep in mind:

1. [Ask the Foundry Agent (preview)](https://ai.azure.com/doc/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-agent/ask-foundry-agent) - an experimental feature you can use to "chat" with an agent that knows the documentation. For instance, ask: _What are my fine tuning options on Azure AI Foundry?_ - and you should get a concise summary with links for deeper exploration.
1. [Use the GitHub Copilot for Azure Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github-copilot-azure/get-started) - this should come pre-installed in your dev container if you launched GitHub Codespaces on the AI Tour repo. Click the _GitHub Copilot_ icon to open the sidebar, switch to "Agent" mode and click the üõ†Ô∏è icon to verify
