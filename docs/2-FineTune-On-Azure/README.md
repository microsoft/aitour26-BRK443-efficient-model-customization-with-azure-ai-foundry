# Act 2: Fine Tuning With Zava

This is your 10-minute speed tour of what fine-tuning looks like on Azure AI Foundry.

1. **Multiple Techniques** 
    - SFT is popular, teaching new behaviors by example.
    - RFT is rewards-based, teaching reasoning models to refine inner CoT
    - DPO is preference-based, helping model prioritize "good" over bad
    - Distillation is model compression - useful if we need a narrower intelligence (focused task) with comparable accuracy to larger "teacher"

2. **Developer Experience**
    - Built-in Safety Guardrails = no catastrophic forgetting
    - Continual Fine-Tuning = iterate quickly for optimization
    - Developer Tiers & Global Availability = makes FT cost-effective
