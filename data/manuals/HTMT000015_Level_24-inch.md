- **Vial Type**: Acrylic block vials with luminescent fluid
- **Weight**: Approximately 1.2 pounds
- **End Caps**: Removable shock-resistant caps

## Vial Configuration

### Horizontal Vial (Center)
- **Location**: Center of level body
- **Function**: Determines level (horizontal) surfaces
- **Sensitivity**: High-precision for accurate readings
- **Markings**: Clear graduation marks for precise positioning

### Vertical Vial (End)
- **Location**: One or both ends of level
- **Function**: Determines plumb (vertical) surfaces
- **Orientation**: 90° to horizontal vial
- **Usage**: Wall and post alignment

### 45-Degree Vial (Optional)
- **Location**: Often integrated into design
- **Function**: Common angle measurements
- **Applications**: Ramp slopes and angled work
- **Convenience**: Eliminates need for angle calculations

## Reading the Vials

### Bubble Position Interpretation
- **Centered**: Bubble between inner marks indicates level/plumb
- **Left of Center**: Surface slopes down to the right
- **Right of Center**: Surface slopes down to the left
- **Sensitivity**: Small movements indicate slight deviations

### Accuracy Standards
- **Professional Grade**: Bubble centered = surface level within specification
- **Tolerance**: Typically ±0.5mm per meter
- **Repeatability**: Consistent readings under same conditions
- **Temperature**: Slight variations with temperature changes

## Applications

### Construction and Framing

- **Floor Installation**: Checking subfloor level
- **Ceiling Work**: Leveling ceiling joists and fixtures
- **Foundation**: Verifying level foundation work

### Finish Carpentry
- **Cabinet Installation**: Level cabinet runs
- **Trim Work**: Straight and level trim installation
- **Door and Window**: Proper frame alignment
- **Shelving**: Level shelf installation

### Plumbing Applications
- **Pipe Runs**: Proper slope for drainage

## Usage Techniques

### Basic Level Reading
1. **Placement**: Position level on surface to be checked
2. **Stability**: Ensure level sits firmly without rocking
3. **Reading**: Observe bubble position in appropriate vial
4. **Adjustment**: Make necessary corrections to achieve level

### Checking for Level
1. **Initial Placement**: Set level on surface
2. **First Reading**: Note bubble position
3. **Reverse Check**: Flip level end-for-end
4. **Comparison**: Bubble should read the same both ways
5. **Accuracy Verification**: Consistent readings confirm accuracy

### Plumb Measurements
1. **Vertical Positioning**: Hold level against vertical surface
2. **Firm Contact**: Ensure good contact along length
3. **Vial Reading**: Check vertical vial bubble position
4. **Adjustment**: Correct surface angle as needed

### Advanced Techniques

#### Finding High Points
- Use level to identify high spots on surfaces
- Work systematically across entire area
- Mark high points for correction
- Verify after adjustments

#### Establishing References
- Use level to establish level reference lines
- Transfer level points to multiple locations
- Create level datum lines for project
- Maintain consistency throughout work

#### Slope Measurements
- Calculate required slope for drainage
- Use level with measured blocks for specific slopes
- Verify slope direction and magnitude
- Check compliance with building codes

## Maintenance and Calibration

### Regular Maintenance
1. **Cleaning**: Keep vials and frame clean
2. **Protection**: Use end caps when not in use
3. **Storage**: Store flat or in protective case
4. **Inspection**: Check for damage before each use

### Accuracy Verification
1. **Flat Surface Test**: Use known flat surface
2. **Reverse Reading**: Check consistency when flipped
3. **Multiple Positions**: Test at various orientations
4. **Professional Check**: Periodic professional calibration

### Vial Care
- **Protection**: Avoid impacts that could damage vials
- **Temperature**: Allow temperature stabilization
- **Fluid Level**: Check for proper fluid levels
- **Replacement**: Professional vial replacement if damaged

## Safety Guidelines

⚠️ **Safety Considerations**
- Handle carefully to prevent damage
- Secure footing when working at height
- Check level accuracy before critical measurements
- Use appropriate fall protection when needed
- Keep hands clear of potential pinch points

### Best Practices
- **Stable Surface**: Ensure stable working platform
- **Clear Vision**: Adequate lighting for reading vials
- **Secure Grip**: Maintain control of level at all times
- **Double Check**: Verify critical measurements

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Inconsistent readings | Damaged or dirty vials | Clean or replace vials |
| Level doesn't sit flat | Bent frame or debris | Check frame straightness, clean |
| Bubble moves erratically | Temperature change or damage | Allow stabilization or inspect for damage |
| Different readings when flipped | Level needs calibration | Professional calibration required |

## Selection Considerations

### Length Selection
- **24-inch**: Good general purpose size
- **Longer Levels**: Better accuracy over distance
- **Shorter Levels**: Better for confined spaces
- **Application**: Match length to typical work

### Accuracy Requirements
