- Knife edge for narrow slots
- Round profiles for smooth transitions
- Angular profiles for crisp edges

## Material Considerations

### Wood Types
- **Hardwoods**: Clean, precise cuts
- **Softwoods**: May require frequent cleaning
- **End Grain**: Excellent control and precision
- **Cross Grain**: Follow with light sanding

### Metals
- **Soft Metals**: Aluminum, brass, copper
- **Steel**: Possible but requires more pressure
- **Precious Metals**: Excellent for jewelry work
- **Cast Iron**: Limited effectiveness

### Other Materials
- **Plastics**: Good for modification work
- **Composites**: Effective on many modern materials
- **Bone/Horn**: Traditional carving materials
- **Stone**: Soft stones only

## Maintenance

### Regular Cleaning
1. Remove debris after each use
2. Use brass brush to clean teeth
3. Work along direction of cut
4. Blow out particles with compressed air

### Deep Cleaning
1. Soak in solvent for stubborn buildup
2. Use fine brass brush
3. Rinse and dry completely
4. Apply light protective oil

### Storage
- Individual protection for each riffler
- Avoid contact between cutting surfaces
- Store in fitted case or roll
- Control humidity to prevent rust

## Safety Guidelines

⚠️ **Safety Considerations**
- Sharp edges require careful handling
- Secure small workpieces properly
- Use appropriate lighting for detail work
- Maintain clean, organized workspace
- Consider dust collection for extended use

### Personal Protection
- **Eyes**: Safety glasses for debris protection
- **Hands**: Careful grip to avoid cuts
- **Respiratory**: Dust mask for fine particles
- **Lighting**: Adequate illumination essential

## Selection Guide

### Choosing the Right Riffler

#### For Concave Curves
- Use curved flat rifflers
- Match curve radius to desired shape
- Consider progressive sizes

#### For Convex Curves
- Half-round profiles work well
- Use flat side for initial shaping
- Curved side for final smoothing

#### For Complex Shapes
- S-curve rifflers for compound curves
- Multiple tools may be needed
- Work in sections and blend

#### For Detail Work
- Pointed and knife-edge profiles
- Fine cut patterns essential
- Good lighting and magnification helpful

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Rough surface finish | Riffler too coarse | Switch to finer cut riffler |
| Tool clogs quickly | Material too soft/sticky | Clean more frequently |
| Poor control | Wrong grip or angle | Adjust hand position |
| Inconsistent results | Unsteady pressure | Practice consistent technique |

## Advanced Applications
