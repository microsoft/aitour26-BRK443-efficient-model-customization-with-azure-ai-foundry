- **Finish**: Smoothest cut quality
- **Speed**: Slower, more controlled cutting

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Setup
1. **Blade Installation**: Insert blade with teeth pointing away from handle
2. **Tension Adjustment**: Apply proper tension - firm but not over-tight
3. **Angle Setting**: Set blade angle for intended cut direction
4. **Workpiece Preparation**: Secure workpiece firmly

### Cutting Technique
1. **Starting**: Begin cut at gentle angle
2. **Pressure**: Light, consistent downward pressure
3. **Stroke**: Use full blade length for efficiency
4. **Direction**: Cut on push stroke, ease off on pull
5. **Curves**: Follow marked line carefully

### Advanced Techniques

#### Interior Cuts
1. Drill starter hole in waste area
2. Disconnect one end of blade
3. Thread blade through hole
4. Reconnect blade and tension
5. Cut interior shape as needed

#### Tight Curves
- Use shortest possible cutting strokes
- Rotate blade frequently to follow curve
- Remove waste material in small sections
- Take time to maintain accuracy

#### Coping Joints
- Cut slightly outside marked line
- Test fit frequently during cutting
- Fine-tune with blade or sandpaper
- Achieve perfect joint fit

## Safety Guidelines

⚠️ **Safety Precautions**
- Always secure workpiece before cutting
- Keep fingers away from blade path
- Use steady, controlled movements
- Ensure adequate lighting for detailed work
- Wear safety glasses for eye protection

### Proper Technique
- **Blade Tension**: Correct tension prevents blade breakage
- **Cutting Speed**: Don't force the cut
- **Support**: Provide adequate workpiece support
- **Direction**: Maintain control of cutting direction

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Blade breaks frequently | Too much tension or forcing cut | Reduce tension, lighter pressure |
| Rough cut quality | Dull blade or wrong TPI | Replace blade or select appropriate TPI |
| Blade wanders | Insufficient tension or dull blade | Increase tension or replace blade |
| Difficult to follow curves | Wrong technique or blade angle | Adjust technique and blade position |

## Blade Changing Process

### Removal
1. Release tension by turning handle
2. Disconnect blade from one pin
3. Remove blade from frame
4. Inspect pins and frame

### Installation
1. Insert new blade in pin slots
2. Ensure teeth point away from handle
3. Apply proper tension gradually
4. Test blade security before cutting
