Plan & buy materials  \n   \u2022 Measure the room: add up the perimeter \u00d7 height for wall area (and ceiling if you\u2019re painting it).  \n   \u2022 Calculate paint needed: most paints cover 350\u2013400 sq ft per gallon. Allow for two coats (and primer, if using).  \n   \u2022 Choose finish (e.g. eggshell or satin for walls, flat for ceilings) and quality paint.  \n   \u2022 Gather tools:  \n     \u2013 Paint (plus primer if covering dark or stained walls)  \n     \u2013 Roller frames, roller covers (11\u201318 mm nap for smooth walls; 18\u201325 mm for light texture)  \n     \u2013 Extension pole for rollers  \n     \u2013 2\u20133\u2033 angled sash brush for cutting in  \n     \u2013 Paint tray and liners  \n     \u2013 Drop cloths or plastic sheeting  \n     \u2013 Painter\u2019s tape (low-tack)  \n     \u2013 Spackle or filler, putty knife  \n     \u2013 Sandpaper (120\u2013220 grit)  \n     \u2013 Ladder or step stool  \n     \u2013 Rags, bucket of clean water (for latex paint)  \n     \u2013 Mild detergent or TSP substitute (for cleaning walls)\n\n2. Prep the room  \n   \u2022 Remove or cover furniture and fixtures; protect floors with drop cloths.  \n   \u2022 Take down switch plates, outlet covers, curtain rods, light-fixture covers.  \n   \u2022 Fill holes and cracks with spackle; let dry, then sand smooth.  \n   \u2022 Wash walls lightly to remove dust or grease; allow to dry completely.  \n   \u2022 Apply painter\u2019s tape along trim, window and door edges, baseboards.\n\n3. Prime (if needed)  \n   \u2022 Use a stain-blocking primer on patched areas or if you\u2019re making a big color change.  \n   \u2022 Let primer dry fully (check manufacturer\u2019s recommended drying time).\n\n4. \u201cCut in\u201d the edges first  \n   \u2022 With your angled sash brush, paint a 2\u20133\u2033 border along ceilings, corners, around windows/doors and baseboards.  \n   \u2022 Work methodically, keeping a wet edge to avoid lap marks.\n\n5. Roll on the main field  \n   \u2022 Pour paint into a tray, fully load the roller, then roll off the excess.  \n   \u2022 Use an extension pole to reach high areas easily and maintain an even pressure.  \n   \u2022 Apply paint in a \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d pattern about 4 ft square, then fill in without lifting the roller. This ensures uniform coverage.  \n   \u2022 Work quickly in sections, blending each new patch into the wet edge of the last.\n\n6. Let first coat dry & inspect  \n   \u2022 Follow paint can instructions for dry time (usually 2\u20134 hours for latex).  \n   \u2022 Look for thin spots or roller lines; lightly sand any drips or bumps with fine-grit sandpaper.\n\n7. Apply the second coat  \n   \u2022 Repeat cutting in and rolling just as you did the first time. Two coats will give the richest, most durable finish.\n\n8. Remove tape & clean up  \n   \u2022 Peel painter\u2019s tape off while paint is still slightly tacky to avoid peeling dried paint.  \n   \u2022 Wash brushes and rollers with warm, soapy water (for latex paint) or the appropriate solvent for oil-based paints.  \n   \u2022 Reinstall hardware, switch plates, curtains, and furniture once everything is fully dry (typically 24 hours).\n\n9. Tips for the best results  \n   \u2022 Work top to bottom: paint the ceiling first (if that\u2019s part of your plan), then walls, then trim.  \n   \u2022 Keep the room well-ventilated for faster drying and to reduce fumes.  \n   \u2022 Maintain a consistent light source (natural or a bright work light) so you can see missed spots and lap marks.  \n   \u2022 Don\u2019t skimp on quality rollers and brushes\u2014they leave fewer fibers behind and give a smoother finish.\n\nWith good prep, the right tools and a systematic approach, you\u2019ll cover your entire room evenly and efficiently\u2014no patchy walls or brush strokes in sight!"}]}

Clean the rim and lid  \n   \u2013 After you\u2019re done painting, wipe any drips or excess paint off the can\u2019s lip and lid with a rag.  \n   \u2013 A clean seal helps keep air\u2014and skinning\u2014out.\n\n2. Add a barrier (water-based paint only)  \n   \u2013 For latex or acrylic paint, you can pour a very thin layer of water (just a tablespoon or two) on top of the paint before sealing.  \n   \u2013 The water floats on top and helps block air. Don\u2019t overdo it\u2014too much water can dilute the paint if it seeps in.\n\n3. Use plastic wrap or a plastic bag  \n   \u2013 Stretch a piece of cling film over the can opening before you press the lid back on.  \n   \u2013 This extra gasket helps block air better than can-lid alone.\n\n4. Seal the lid tightly  \n   \u2013 Place the lid on straight and tap it down gently with a rubber mallet or the handle of a screwdriver.  \n   \u2013 Avoid bending the lid\u2019s flange or you\u2019ll compromise the seal.\n\n5. Store the can upside down  \n   \u2013 Turning the can upside down (lid on the floor) creates an airtight seal around the rim.  \n   \u2013 Keep it on a stable surface where it won\u2019t accidentally tip.\n\n6. Keep in a cool, dry place  \n   \u2013 Avoid direct sunlight, high heat or freezing temperatures.  \n   \u2013 A basement, garage shelf or utility closet is ideal\u2014just don\u2019t let it freeze.\n\n7. Consider a smaller container  \n   \u2013 If you only have a little paint left, transfer it to a clean, airtight jar or plastic tub sized for the amount you have.  \n   \u2013 Less air space helps keep paint from skinning over.\n\n8. Use a paint conditioner or retarder  \n   \u2013 For longer open-time (especially in hot/dry climates), mix in a few drops of commercial paint conditioner designed for your paint type.  \n\nBy following these steps you\u2019ll minimise air exposure and temperature shocks\u2014and your paint will stay smooth and usable for your next touch-up."}]}

Prepare the room and surface  \n   \u2022 Move furniture out or to the room\u2019s center and cover with dust sheets.  \n   \u2022 Remove or mask off light fixtures, vents and trim with painter\u2019s tape.  \n   \u2022 Fill any holes or cracks with a suitable filler, sand smooth and dust off.\n\n2. Choose the right products and tools  \n   \u2022 Paint: use a quality ceiling or flat interior paint (often paint+primer in one). Flat finishes hide imperfections best.  \n   \u2022 Roller frame & pole: lightweight frame with extension pole to keep your arm straight up.  \n   \u2022 Roller cover: low\u2010nap (\u00bc\" to \u00bd\") microfiber or woven roller for minimal stipple.

Roll using the \u201cWet-Edge W\u201d technique  \n   \u2022 Load your roller lightly\u2014dip, then roll off excess in the pan\u2019s grid. Overloaded rollers drip and leave thick edges.  \n   \u2022 Start at one corner; paint a loose \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d shape about 1\u2009m\u00b2 in area.  \n   \u2022 Without reloading, fill in the shape with parallel strokes, then finish with a light, un-reloaded pass in one direction (usually toward the nearest wall) to even out the paint.  \n   \u2022 Always overlap your previous section by a few inches while the paint is still wet to avoid lap lines.\n\n5. Maintain consistent pressure and pace  \n   \u2022 Don\u2019t press hard. Let the roller\u2019s nap do the work. Light, even pressure gives the most uniform texture.  \n   \u2022 Work at a steady pace so the paint doesn\u2019t start to dry before you blend edges.\n\n6. Inspect and touch up immediately  \n   \u2022 As you go, glance back under good light (a bright work lamp at an angle reveals marks).  \n   \u2022 While still wet, smooth out any ridges or thick spots with a light re-roll.\n\n7.

Topcoat with quality latex or acrylic paint  \n    \u2022  Once the encapsulating primer is cured, finish with your chosen topcoat.  \n    \u2022  This provides UV protection and abrasion resistance for the seal.  \n\n8.  Clean up and disposal  \n    \u2022  Wet-wipe all plastic sheeting, tools and work surfaces.  \n    \u2022  Collect wipes, rags, and plastic in heavy-duty bags; label as lead-paint waste if local rules require.  \n    \u2022  Check your municipality\u2019s hazardous-waste rules for where to drop off.  \n\n9.  Final check  \n    \u2022  Do a wet wipe or HEPA-vacuum of the area to remove any remaining dust.  \n    \u2022  Keep children and pregnant women out of the work area until everything is cleaned up.  \n\nImportant reminders:  \n\u2022  If you need to disturb more than 2 sq ft (interior) or 20 sq ft (exterior) of lead paint, U.S. federal rules generally require an EPA\u2010certified contractor.  \n\u2022  Always follow local regulations\u2014some areas have tighter rules than the federal minimum.  \n\u2022  When in doubt, hire an EPA\u2010certified lead renovator.  \n\nBy encapsulating rather than stripping, you avoid generating hazardous lead dust. Done properly, this is one of the safest and most cost-effective ways to \u201cpaint over\u201d lead paint."}]}

Prepare your workspace   \n \u2022 Work outdoors or in a very well-ventilated area.  \n \u2022 Lay down a drop cloth to catch drips and protect the floor.  \n\n2. Clean the wicker thoroughly  \n \u2022 Dust first with a soft brush or vacuum with a brush attachment.  \n \u2022 Mix warm water with a mild dish soap.  \n \u2022 Scrub gently with a soft-bristle brush or sponge, getting into all the crevices.  \n \u2022 Rinse well with clean water (a spray-bottle rinse works nicely).  \n \u2022 Let it dry completely\u2014ideally 24 hours\u2014before moving on.  \n\n3. Remove loose paint and rough spots  \n \u2022 If old paint is peeling or chipping, use a small wire brush or medium-grit sandpaper (120\u2013150 grit) to knock off all loose flakes.  \n \u2022 Lightly sand the entire surface (this gives new primer and paint something to \u201cgrab\u201d onto).  \n \u2022 Wipe away dust with a tack cloth or a damp microfiber towel.  \n\n4. Mask off areas you don\u2019t want painted  \n \u2022 Use painter\u2019s tape to cover glides, hardware, cushions, etc.  \n\n5. Prime the wicker  \n \u2022 Choose a primer formulated for your material:  \n   \u2013 For natural wicker/rattan, use a quality oil- or water-based bonding primer.  \n   \u2013 For resin/poly-wicker, choose a primer labeled for plastics or vinyl.  \n \u2022 Apply in thin, even coats, using either:  \n   \u2013 Spray primer (fastest for intricate weaving)  \n   \u2013 A small foam or synthetic-bristle brush  \n \u2022 Allow the primer to dry thoroughly (follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommended dry time).  \n\n6. Paint in thin, even coats  \n Option A: Spray paint  \n   \u2022 Use a spray paint made for outdoor furniture or all-surface enamel.  \n   \u2022 Hold the can about 25\u201330 cm from the surface.  \n   \u2022 Apply multiple light coats rather than one heavy coat\u2014this avoids drips and pooling.  \n\n Option B: Brush-on paint  \n   \u2022 Use a high-quality exterior acrylic or alkyd enamel paint.  \n   \u2022 With a small synthetic-bristle brush, work into gaps and around curves.  \n   \u2022 Wipe excess paint from the brush before each pass to prevent blobs.  \n   \u2022 Let each coat dry fully, then lightly sand (220 grit) before applying the next coat.  \n\n7. Apply 2\u20133 coats for even coverage  \n \u2022 Allow proper flash time (check can instructions) between coats.  \n \u2022 Inspect under good light to catch any thin spots or drips.  \n\n8. Seal (optional but recommended for outdoor furniture)  \n \u2022 Once the paint is fully cured (often 24\u201348 hours), brush or spray on a clear exterior polyurethane or clear acrylic sealer.  \n \u2022 This adds UV protection and helps resist scratches and mildew.  \n\n9. Cure and reassemble  \n \u2022 Give the piece a full 48\u201372 hours to cure before heavy use or exposure to rain.  \n \u2022 Remove tape, reattach hardware, and put cushions back on.  \n\nTips & Tricks  \n \u2022 Temperature and humidity matter\u2014ideal conditions are 15\u201325 \u00b0C (60\u201375 \u00b0F) and low humidity.  \n \u2022 Protect your lungs\u2014wear a mask rated for paint fumes and primer vapors.  \n \u2022 Work in sections\u2014finish the back or underside first in case of drips.  \n\nFollowing these steps will help you achieve a smooth, long-lasting finish on your wicker furniture.

Preparation  \n   \u2022 Clear the space \u2013 remove pictures, furniture or cover with drop cloths.  \n   \u2022 Protect floors and trim \u2013 lay down tarp or plastic sheeting and use painter\u2019s tape along skirting boards, door frames and light switches.  \n   \u2022 Patch and sand \u2013 fill nail holes or cracks with filler, let dry, then lightly sand smooth. Wipe walls with a damp cloth to remove dust.\n\n2. Choose the right paint and tools  \n   \u2022 Paint finish \u2013 an eggshell or satin finish cleans easily and reflects a bit of light to visually widen the hallway.  \n   \u2022 Light colors \u2013 soft neutrals, pastels or off-whites make narrow spaces feel larger and brighter.  \n   \u2022 Roller size \u2013 use a 4\u20136 inch mini roller with a medium-nap cover (\u215c\u2033\u2013\u00bd\u2033 nap) for better maneuverability in tight spaces.  \n   \u2022 Angled sash brush (2\u20132\u00bd\u2033) \u2013 ideal for cutting in around trim, corners and light fixtures.  \n   \u2022 Extension pole \u2013 helps reach higher walls and ceilings without a ladder.\n\n3. Cutting in  \n   \u2022 Start with edges \u2013 use your angled brush to \u201ccut in\u201d a 2\u20133 inch border along the ceiling line, corners and around door frames.  \n   \u2022 Work in 4\u20135 foot sections to keep a wet edge and minimize visible overlaps.\n\n4. Rolling the walls  \n   \u2022 Load roller sparingly \u2013 overload can drip in a narrow space. Roll off excess paint on the tray\u2019s slope.  \n   \u2022 Top to bottom \u2013 roll from ceiling line down to the top of the cut-in band, then finish the strip down to the floor in smooth \u2018W\u2019 or \u2018M\u2019 strokes.  \n   \u2022 Blend each section \u2013 before the paint skins over, lightly roll the junction between the fresh paint and the cut-in area to even out texture.\n\n5. Second coat  \n   \u2022 Dry time \u2013 allow the first coat to dry fully (check your paint can for recommended time).  \n   \u2022 Inspect light-facing walls \u2013 if the previous coat looks uneven, apply a second coat using the same technique.\n\n6. Ceilings and trim (if needed)  \n   \u2022 Ceilings first \u2013 if you\u2019re also painting the ceiling, do it before the walls to avoid splatter. Use a roller with a \u00be\u2033 nap.  \n   \u2022 Trim last \u2013 finish baseboards, door frames and moldings with a semi-gloss or gloss paint for durability; use a small sash brush for crisp lines.\n\n7. Cleanup and inspection  \n   \u2022 Remove tape \u2013 pull away painter\u2019s tape at a 45\u00b0 angle while paint is still slightly tacky to get clean edges.  \n   \u2022 Touch-ups \u2013 after everything\u2019s dry, check for minor drips or thin spots and gently fix with a small brush.  \n   \u2022 Ventilate \u2013 keep doors or windows open to speed drying and dissipate fumes.\n\nBonus tips  \n   \u2013 Good lighting: place a work light or bulb at one end to spot uneven coverage.  \n   \u2013 Step ladder: in very narrow halls you can often lean a drywall stilts or a narrow stepladder against one wall for easy access without blocking too much space.  \n   \u2013 Ventilation: an open window or small fan helps paint cure faster and improves comfort.\n\nWith careful prep, the right tools and light-reflecting colors, your narrow hallway will look bright, fresh and more spacious.

Choose the right paint and tools  \n   \u2022 Use a quality ceiling paint or flat latex formulated for low sheen and good hide.  \n   \u2022 Pick a roller cover with the proper nap: 9\u201312 mm (\u215c\"\u2013\u00bd\") nap is ideal for most ceilings to hold enough paint without overloading.  \n   \u2022 Use an extension pole so you can keep a steady arm position and consistent pressure across the whole area.\n\n2. Prepare and prime the surface  \n   \u2022 Clean the ceiling of dust, cobwebs and any loose paint.  \n   \u2022 Repair cracks or holes with spackling compound, then sand smooth.  \n   \u2022 If the ceiling is new drywall or stained, apply a ready-mixed drywall primer or stain-blocking primer. A consistent base helps the topcoat flow more evenly.\n\n3. Work methodically and keep a wet edge  \n   \u2022 Divide the ceiling into manageable sections\u2014about 1.2\u20131.5 m (4\u20135 ft) wide\u2014marking them in your mind or lightly with chalk.  \n   \u2022 Load your roller and start at one corner. Roll a \u201cW\u201d or \u201cM\u201d shape across the first section, then fill in without lifting the roller.  \n   \u2022 Always finish each section back to its starting point before the paint skins over. This \u201cwet edge\u201d prevents a second pass from drying before you overlap it.\n\n4. Maintain even pressure and overlap correctly  \n   \u2022 Don\u2019t press too hard\u2014let the roller\u2019s nap do the work.  \n   \u2022 Overlap each pass by about 10\u201315 cm (4\u20136 in). Too little overlap leaves gaps; too much can lead to heavy spots that lap.  \n   \u2022 Reload the roller frequently so you\u2019re not patching dry spots or rolling out with a nearly empty cover.\n\n5. Control your environment  \n   \u2022 Paint when temperatures are between 10\u201325 \u00b0C (50\u201377 \u00b0F) and humidity is moderate.  \n   \u2022 Good ventilation speeds drying but avoid strong drafts that could cause the edges to set up unevenly.  \n   \u2022 If you need a second coat, wait until the first coat is fully dry (check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions\u2014often 4\u20136 hours) and repeat the same wet-edge technique.\n\n6. Final pass for a uniform finish  \n   \u2022 Once the first coat is dry, do one more \u201clight\u201d finish roll: back-roll each section with a roller that has a thin film of paint, going in one direction only.  \n   \u2022 This evens out any slight overlaps or texture differences.\n\nFollowing these steps\u2014good prep, the right roller, consistent loading, and maintaining a wet edge\u2014will help you achieve a smooth, uniform ceiling without lap marks.
