    "Zava's chatbot is now polite and helpful. But it uses GPT-4.1, which is is too , slow, and expensive for the simple task assigned to it. _Can we get the same behavior, with comparable quality, using a smaller model that would be faster and cheaper?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore _distillation_, the process by which we use a larger model (GPT-4.1) to teach a smaller model (e.g., GPT-4.1-nano) to do a specific task, with comparable accuracy. It achieves this by trading off the breadth of knowledge of larger models for a _narrower intelligence_ that is more cost-effective. This technique is also referred to as _model compression_ since it effectively reduces the size of model used in the solution. The figure shows the basic workflow we will cover in this lab.\n",
