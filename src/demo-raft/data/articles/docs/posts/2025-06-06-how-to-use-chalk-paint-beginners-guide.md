## About Chalk Paint

If you're looking to paint furniture for the first time, look no further than this step-by-step tutorial. Chalk Paint is a fantastic tool for giving your furniture a whole new look in next to no time. You don't need to be a professional painter to achieve stunning results – you just need the paint colour of your choice, a brush and some Chalk Paint Wax to protect your finish.

Whichever piece of furniture you're painting, you don't have to worry about sanding or priming first. You can get straight into the fun bit! Chalk Paint has incredible sticking power and will go onto almost any surface, even varnished pine or laminate. You can apply it thickly for a rustic, textured look or smoothly for a slick modern look. 

Once you're happy with the paintwork, it's time to seal it in for a lasting finish: choose Chalk Paint Wax for indoor use or Chalk Paint Lacquer for high traffic areas or outdoor use.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use Chalk Paint on outdoor garden furniture?**
A: While Chalk Paint with lacquer can handle some outdoor exposure, wooden garden benches that stay outside all year require specialized exterior paints. The best paint for outdoor wood furniture needs weather-resistant formulations with UV blockers and moisture barriers that traditional chalk paints don't provide. For garden benches exposed to year-round weather conditions, consider outdoor paints specifically designed for outdoor wooden furniture durability.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Painting Furniture with Chalk Paint

1. **Remove Hardware** - Remove any hardware, such as handles, from your furniture if possible.

2. **Clean the Surface** - Give your piece a quick clean with a damp cloth (avoid any harsh chemicals).

3. **Prepare the Paint** - Stir your chosen Chalk Paint colour. You can use a stir stick or anything else you have to hand.

4. **Apply First Coat** - Dip your brush in, and apply the paint straight onto the furniture. As you paint, move the brush in every direction and all over the piece.

5. **Wait for Drying** - Wait for the first coat to be touch dry. Depending on the climate, this could take 1-3 hours.

6. **Apply Second Coat** - Once dry, apply a second coat in the same manner.

7. **Final Drying** - Wait for the paint to be fully dry.

8. **Apply Wax** - Next, apply Chalk Paint Wax in the same manner as the paint. Use a brush or lint-free cloth to apply in all directions. Work in sections removing any excess with a lint-free cloth as you go. You want to make sure every bit of paintwork has been waxed.

9. **Curing Period** - And that's it! You can use the piece of furniture as soon as the wax is touch dry, but please note it will take up to 2 weeks to reach its full hardness (known as the 'curing period'). During this time, take extra care with the piece.

## Getting Started

Now you've followed these simple steps, you're ready to get painting. It's easy to update furniture with Chalk Paint, whether you've inherited an old piece of furniture or found one at a flea market. Perhaps you simply want to update something you already own that doesn't suit your style anymore.
