## Why Paint Garden Furniture?

When we get some warm weather in the UK, we want to make the most of it and enjoy our outdoor spaces. There is no better way to do that than to enjoy your own garden, which is one of the main parts of the home that we want to look beautiful no matter the time of year. That is why every year one of the first jobs to tick off the DIY jobs list is to give the garden a refresh, transforming it to a little haven for you to enjoy some al-fresco dining, or some sunbathing!

Painting garden furniture has a range of benefits, that include:

- Offers a much cheaper alternative to buying new outdoor furniture.
- You can pick any colour to express your personality.
- It is a fantastic way to brighten up an outdoor space.
- Painting provides added durability and protection from the elements.

## The Best Garden Furniture Paints

Garden furniture comes in many materials — wood, metal, and plastic — so there isn't a single paint that fits all. Below are the common options and the types of finishes they provide.

### The Best Paint For Wooden Garden Furniture

Wood can be treated with varnish, stain, or paint:

- Wood varnish — forms a clear protective barrier on the wood.
- Wood stain — penetrates the wood and preserves the grain while adding colour.
- Wood paint — opaque finishes that completely cover the grain.

Recommended product types (examples mentioned by the source): Zava Yacht Varnish, Zava Classic Woodstain, Zava Superdec Satin, Zava Allcoat Exterior.

### The Best Paint For Metal & Plastic Garden Furniture

For metal and many plastics, use an appropriate metal/plastic-capable exterior paint or a multi-surface product. Zava Allcoat Exterior is frequently recommended as a versatile, self-priming option with long durability.

## How To Paint Garden Furniture

Preparation is the single most important part of any decorating project. Before painting garden furniture, ensure the surface is clean, dry, and free from anything that will impact adhesion.

Here is a simple step-by-step guide:

1. Remove all loose paint and dirt with a scraper or stiff brush.
2. Sand the surface with light-grit (key the surface) to help adhesion.
3. Wipe away dust with a damp cloth.
4. If required by the product, apply a suitable primer. (Many of the recommended products are self-priming.)
5. Apply the paint or stain evenly — many systems are two-coat.
6. Allow to dry completely before applying a topcoat.

## Ideas For Painting Garden Furniture

Looking for inspiration for your outdoor space? Here are some popular colour ideas and themes for painting your garden furniture:

- Gentle colour: mellow tones (e.g. light blues and pinks) can brighten a space without being overpowering.
- Creative furniture: upcycle items and paint planters, benches and tables for a coordinated look.
- Go full colour: pick a bold RAL/paint shade for a striking focal point in the garden.
