## 2. Prepare Demos Early

This session focuses on Fine-Tuning for model customization. This is not a technique you can demo "live" given it requires an hour or more for even the simplest demo.

Instead, we recommend the "Cooking demo" approach:

1. Setup the demo **a day in advance**. Check that FT jobs completed.
1. Keep the demo staged on your laptop during your session.
1. Play the pre-recorded demo video during the talk itself.
1. Switch to staged demo only to show final outcome or answer questions.

## 4. Session Pacing

The figure below shows a high-level view of the speaker deck sections. This is a 45-minute session with three demos that will take up most of the time, so pace yourself accordingly. **When necessary, prioritize demo time over slides**.

![Speaker Deck](./../docs/assets/Speaker-Deck.png)

The talk is structured as four acts. Here is how we suggest you allocate time:

- **Row 1** - _Welcome_: Introduction & Agenda (1 min)
- **Row 2** - _Act 1_: Unlock Business Value with Fine Tuning (10 min)
- **Row 3** - _Act 2_: Fine Tuning In Azure AI Foundry (Demo) (10 min)
- **Row 4** - _Act 3_: Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (Demo) (10 min)
- **Row 5** - _Wrap-up_: Take-away Messages & CTAs (4 min)

The table below gives a slighly more detailed breakdown - this is a recommended flow but please feel free to reduce time spent on slides _and focus more time on the demos_. 

| Row | Time | Description | Slides |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | 1 min | Welcome attendees · Introduce yourself and session topic | 3-4 |
| 2 | 10 min  | Introduce Zava Scenario · Explain their model customization journey · How can Azure AI Foundry help Zava? | 5-11 |
| 3 | 2 min  | Introduce fine-tuning options on Azure · Explain platform benefits | 12-15 |
|  | 4 min  | How Basic Fine Tuning Works · Let's See The Demo  | 14, Play Recording |
|  | 4 min  | How Distillation Works · Let's See The Demo  | 16, Play Recording |
| 4 | 5 min  | What is Retrieval-Augemented Fine Tuning? | 18-23 |
|   | 15 min  | How RAFT Works · Let's See The Demo  | 24-25, Play Recording |
| 5 | 5 min | 2 Takeaway Messages · Recap Visual · Venue CTA (TBA) | 27-30 |
| | | 

You will not have time for Q&A during the session given the content - instead, we recommend you ask listeners to come speak to you after the session. This also gives you time to show relevant outcomes or answer questions _using the staged version of the demo on your laptop_ for more realistic interactions.

## 5. Session Demo (Setup) - `TO-FIX`  🚧

_TBD_ - provide guidance on how to setup demos, or point to where this is described.
