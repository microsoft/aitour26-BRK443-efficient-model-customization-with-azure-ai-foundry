## 1. File Summary

Note that fine-tuning is not something you can demo live (given it takes a couple of hours or more for even the smallest demo). Instead, we recommend setting up the demo a day before - then playing pre-recorded videos to show the concept, and switching to your deployment only to show key aspects or answer questions.
