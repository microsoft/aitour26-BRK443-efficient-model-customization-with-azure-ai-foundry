## 2. Prepare Demos Early

This session focuses on Fine-Tuning for model customization. This is not a technique you can demo "live" given it requires an hour or more for even the simplest demo.

Instead, we recommend the "Cooking demo" approach:

1. Setup the demo **a day in advance**. Check that FT jobs completed.
1. Keep the demo staged on your laptop during your session.
1. Play the pre-recorded demo video during the talk itself.
1. Switch to staged demo only to show final outcome or answer questions.
