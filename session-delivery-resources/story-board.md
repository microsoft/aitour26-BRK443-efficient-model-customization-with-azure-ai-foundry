# 2: Know Customization Options

1. Set The Stage - Fine Tune for Behavior, Cost, Precision
1. Start with SFT - Understand workflow, Implement behavior
1. Try Distillation - Transfer intelligence (reuse data), Reduce cost
1. Understand RFT - Rewards-based (less data), Improve reasoning
1. Motivate Hybrid - Use RAG with FT, Improve response quality

# 3: Hands-on With RAFT

1. Set The Stage - What is the desired objective? (Precision)
1. Understand RAFT - How does RAG with FT work in practice?
1. Prepare The Data - Understand oracle documents vs. distractors
1. Run Fine-Tuning Job - Execute the workflow in Azure AI Foundry
1. Validate Results - See how RAFT improves precision of responses

## The Session

In this session, you will learn how to customize AI models and optimize their performance (for your scenario) using targeted fine-tuning methods. 

- Discussion focuses on Distillation, RFT and RAFT approaches using Azure AI Foundry
- Demos show how you can reduce costs & improve precision with less data and complexity.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

1. Understand how model customization helps meet cost & performance objectives
1. Know the model customization options (Prompt Engineering, RAG, Fine-Tuning)
1. Explain how Fine-Tuning works, and its benefits & tradeoffs for customization
1. Describe Fine-Tuning options available in Azure AI Foundry (SFT, RFT & more)
1. Use Distillation (model compression) in Azure AI Foundry, to reduce cost
1. Use RAFT (hybrid RAG + Fine Tuning) in Azure AI Foundry, to improve precision
